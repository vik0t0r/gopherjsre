# gopherjsRE README

gopherjsRE is my first attempt to read the javascript code generated by gopherjs from a golan source. 

## Features

1. Split a gopherjs bundle into multiple files, one for each package
2. Beautify and rename symbols inside each package

## Requirements

1. From npm its needed the "fs" and "path" modules for accessing the filesystem, they are already packed on the .vsix file
2. From the vscode extension marketplace its needed [formatter hero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wscats.qf) to beautify code.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of gopherjsRE

## How to use the extension
1. Download and install the extension gopherjsRE
2. Open the .js file generated by gopherjs with the -m option (minified)
3. Run the command "Gopherjs split files", this will split each package into ist own file on the "output" directory 
4. Open one file in the output directory
5. Run the "Gopherjs decompile one file", this will try to recover most symbols, and comment out some boilerplate.
